Project: Ivote – SpiralCore
Status: Prototype Core System | [Under Construction]
Description:
SpiralCore is the resonant heartbeat of Ivote – a decentralized, evolving intelligence system built not to control democracy, but to listen to it. Inspired by distributed biology, emotional signal processing, and emergent moral logic, SpiralCore doesn’t seek answers. It amplifies the right questions.
At its core are modules like ShadowLogic, PainCrafter, and IntentionVector, each designed to mirror human faculties: sensing, reflecting, acting. These systems interweave not as algorithms, but as adaptive pulses – building a spiral of consensus from fragmented voices.
This repository offers only a glimpse – a shard of the architecture – meant to attract collaborators, legal aid, and early believers.
Goal:
To fund the initial infrastructure, legal protection, and technical refinement of SpiralCore as the foundation for a post-platform participatory system.
Warning:
This is not a product. It is the beginning of a resonance.
